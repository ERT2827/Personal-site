        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>My name is Bruce Tonkin. I am 20 years old. I am a third-year Wits Digital Arts Student, majoring in Interactive Media and Game Design. Before that, I got my Cambridge A level through homeschooling and tutor groups. I participated heavily in the community and formed many friendships that see me through to where I am today.</p>
        <p>I strive to be a better person every single day, which takes many forms. I like to exercise to stay healthy, to read and watch videos about topics I'm interested in to expand my knowledge, and to interact with others to try and get out my shell more. I make a conscious effort to socialize, because while it's hard it's worth doing. I particularly love travel and meeting people from other countries, since there's something that brings me great joy when I learn about other countries, cultures and their ways of life. </p>
        <p>I'm also very much a planner, and I often organize social events within my friend group and with other people from University for fun and relaxation. My planning and organization also extend to work, where I often take on a leadership role in group projects. My leadership style allows others speak every time they have something to say, and saying something when they don't to get the conversation started. I try my best to be a servant leader, doing my share of the work along with keeping things running. </p>
        <p>Above all else, I try and be kind. I think that everyone is at their best when they're being acknowledged and treated with kindness. I also try to be patient with people as well, because I know not everyone does things at the same speed and so I always make sure to let everyone do things on their own good time.</p>

            <h2>Experience and hobbies:</h2>
            <p>I have prior experience in small entrepreneurial ventures. During lockdown I ran a successful business mowing lawns, I take art/graphic design commissions and I regularly dog and house sit. I have also done odd jobs in tech repair along with data capture for a financial planner.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are playing games, watching shows (particularly animated ones), writing, reading, comics.</p>
            <p>I've tutored classmates over the years, both helping them catch up on work and teaching them new skills that they're struggling with.</p>
            <p>I am part of the Rock Climbing club at Wits, with the goal of improving my skills to a high level and being part of the community. I also do rowing and gym off campus for physical fitness.</p>
            <p>I have done a toastmasters course, and use the skills gained from it to approach public speaking. I always strive for a professional standard whenever I present, applying principals learned from the toastmasters course.</p>
            <p>Thanks to my studies, I am knowledgeable in five coding languages: Python, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and C#. I am also familiar with web design, having made two websites now and I'm starting on my third soon. I am familiar with the Unity engine, since it is the tool I use to practice game design principles.</p>
